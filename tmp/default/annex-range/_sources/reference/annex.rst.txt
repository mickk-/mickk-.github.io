Annex quick reference
=====================

.. namespace:: ::annex

This library is part of the |annex| series of libraries and as such relies on certain conventions and pre-defined
concepts. The most common and important ones are briefly documented here, while the library proper is documented in the
rest of the :doc:`/reference`.

.. _concepts-for-variables:

Concepts for variables
----------------------

The |annex| series of libraries follow the philosophy of `Concepts for variables`_. Not all concepts are written for
variables however, but the two can be easily distinguished:

- concepts for variables introduce a `Variable` constraint on at least one parameter, but not necessarily all::

   template<Variable Func, typename... Args> concept bool Invokable = ...;

- concepts for types follow the naming convention of ending in ``-Type``, starting with the trivial concept `Type`::

   template<typename X> concept bool Type = true;
   Type{X} concept bool StorableType = ...;

.. _Concepts for variables: http://mickk-on-cpp.github.io

.. _forward-storing:

Forward Storing
---------------

It's common in C++ for generic data to come with factory function templates, to reduce boilerplate thanks to template
argument deduction. `std::make_tuple` is a very prominent example of such and many factories use the ``make_*`` naming
convention::

    auto xs = std::make_tuple(0, 'a', "bcd");
    // more convenient than:
    std::tuple<int, char, const char*> xs = { 0, 'a', "bcd" };

Unfortunately, the generic `std::tuple` actually comes with *three* factories: `std::make_tuple`, `std::tie`, and
`std::forward_as_tuple` which each have a particular purpose. The |annex| series of libraries instead typically provides
one factory per generic type which can serve those three purposes simultaneously:

==========================================      =============================================================
``std::make_tuple(a, std::ref(b))``             ``annex::tuples::tuple(decay(a), b)``
``std::tie(a, b, c)``                           ``annex::tuples::tuple(a, b, c)``
``std::forward_as_tuple(a, std::move(b))``      ``annex::tuples::tuple(a, std::move(b))`` [#tuple-note]_
==========================================      =============================================================

.. [#tuple-note]
    ``std::forward_as_tuple(0)`` and ``annex::tuples::tuple(0)`` differ in that the former creates an
    ``std::tuple<int&&>``, the latter an ``std::tuple<int>``.

When the circumstances call for it a traditional, additional ``make_*`` factory is sometimes provided as well.

.. _function:

Function
--------

The |annex| series of libraries attempts to avoid namespace-scope functions and function templates, favouring instead
namespace-scope constant function objects or variable templates. That is, something such as ``annex::decay(0)`` calls a
particular ``operator()`` overload on a constant named ``decay``. The motivation behind this is as follows:

- to avoid unwanted and uncontrolled use of Argument-Dependent Lookup
- to encourage and facilitate higher-order manipulation; e.g. ``auto& dc = annex::decay;`` is an easy way to alias a
  :ref:`function`. Perhaps more importantly the referred ``decay`` object can be passed to another :ref:`function` using
  this very same mechanism::

      assert( annex::tuples::map(dc, std::make_tuple(0)) == std::make_tuple(0) );

  If ``decay`` were a function template, something such as the following would have to be used as a verbose workaround::

      auto function_object = [](auto&&... args)
      {
          // explicitly qualify to avoid unwanted ADL
          return annex::decay(std::forward<decltype(args)>(args)...);
      };
      assert( annex::tuples::map(function_object, std::make_tuple(0)) == std::make_tuple(0) );

  Transforming the function template into a function object so that it can be passed as an argument is pure boilerplate.
  In a sense the |annex| libraries take this precaution ahead of time for convenience to the user.

Eric Niebler elaborates on the benefits of function-like objects in his post `Customization Point Design in C++11 and
Beyond`_, especially as it relates to ADL.

.. note::

  |annex| functions are not customization points and do not perform ADL on behalf of the user unless otherwise
  specified.

.. _Customization Point Design in C++11 and Beyond: http://ericniebler.com/2014/10/21/customization-point-design-in-c11-and-beyond/

For conciseness, and because their nature as objects is mostly an implementation detail, function-like objects are still
referred to as *functions*. Additionally, functions are consistently defined as follows throughout |annex| libraries
(e.g. for an assumed ``foo`` function):

- the constant lives in its relevant |annex| namespace or subnamespace, e.g. ``annex::tuples::foo``
- it has type ``annex::tuples::functors::foo const``
- there is an associated ``annex::tuples::result_of::foo<X, Y, Z>`` alias which is short for::

    decltype( annex::tuples::foo(std::declval<X>(), std::declval<Y>(), std::declval<Z>() )

- some functions are parametrised over types and constants, in which case they are constant templates e.g.
  ``annex::tuples::foo<int, 0>`` of type ``annex::tuples::functors::foo<int, 0> const`` and with alias
  ``annex::tuples::result_of::foo<int, 0, X, Y, Z>`` short for::

      decltype( annex::tuples::foo<int, 0>(std::declval<X>(), std::declval<Y>(), std::declval<Z>()) )

  Due to limitations in the language, constant templates that accept a variadic number of arguments cannot have a
  ``result_of`` alias::

      auto res = annex::tuples::reorder_to<int, char>(tup);
      // not possible:
      // using res_t = annex::tuples::result_of::reorder_to<int, char, decltype(tup)&>;

- functions have additional functionality, e.g. they can be partially applied::

      assert( annex::tuples::foo(0, 'a', -1., "hello") == annex::tuples::foo.partial(0).partial('a', -1.)("hello") );

  A call to ``partial`` produces a new function-like object, which can in turn be subject to a call to ``partial``
  again, or be invoked with final arguments. Many functions take ``partial`` into account when it comes to parameter
  order to help with higher-order usage::

      using annex::tuples::map;
      auto succ = [](auto arg) { ++arg; return arg; };
      assert( map(map.partial(succ), std::make_tuple(std::make_tuple(0, 1), std::make_tuple(2)))
              == std::make_tuple(std::make_tuple(1, 2), std::make_tuple(3)) );

.. _simple-model:

Simple model
------------

A *simple model* of a concept is intended to be the least surprising possible type which fulfils this concept, given
some parameters. In particular, simple models associated with a factory :ref:`function` behave according to the
following (e.g. assuming an associated ``annex::ns::foo`` factory):

- the name of the class or class template that will model the concept follows closely that of the :ref:`function`, e.g.
  ``annex::ns::foo_type``
- a valid call ``annex::ns::foo(a, b, c)`` produces an ``annex::ns::foo_type<A, B, C>`` result, where ``A``, ``B``, and
  ``C`` are types related to ``a``, ``b``, and ``c`` respectively (e.g. a :ref:`forward storing <forward-storing>`
  :ref:`function` called as ``annex::ns::foo(i, std::move(j), 0)`` yields an ``annex::ns::foo_type<int&, int, int>``
  assuming all ``int`` arguments); while ``annex::ns::foo<X, Y, Z>(a, b, c)`` would produce an ``annex::ns::foo_type<X,
  Y, Z, A, B, C>`` result
- some or all of the parameters used to construct the simple model may be available as public data members::

      namespace range = annex::range;
      // decltype( res ) is intended as the least surprising model of a range of ints from 0 to 6 exclusive
      auto res = range::interval(0, 6);
      // names of data members documented by interval
      assert( res.context.from == 0 );
      assert( res.context.to   == 6 );


  .. warning::
      The data members are made public so that the values used to construct the simple model can be retrieved, which
      usually takes place **after** normal usage. Hence the members are able to be accessed mutably so as to allow
      moves.

      However those data members are used by the type in order to fulfil the concept operations and are not merely
      copies of the parameters used at construction--the user should store its own if that's what they need. This means
      that modifying those members before or during use of the associated concept operations should be done at own risk,
      and considered extremely brittle.

Because a simple model is closely associated to its factory :ref:`function`, its precise capabilities are normally
described in the function documentation.

Concepts
--------

Base & convenience concepts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. concept:: template<typename X> Type

    The trivial concept satisfied by any type. It's used as a shortcut for template introductions::

        Type{Item} Item* addressof(Item& item);

.. concept:: template<typename... Xs> Types = (... && Type<Xs>)

    A variadic variant of `Type`, for introducing multiple parameters and/or a pack::

        Types{First, ... Rest} tuple<First, Rest...> accept(First&& first, Rest&&... rest);

.. concept:: Type{X} Variable

    The basis of :ref:`concepts-for-variables`. It is the minimal constraint for the following::

        Variable{Var} struct generic_data { Var member; };

        Variable{Var} void generic_function(generic_data<Var> arg);

.. concept:: Types{... Xs} Variables = (... && Variable<Xs>)

    A variadic variant of `Variable`, for introducing multiple parameters and/or a pack.

.. concept:: Types{... Pack} NonEmptyPack = sizeof...(Pack) != 0

    A pseudo-concept for constraining variadic templates that are not valid for empty packs.

Sister concepts are usually presented together, alongside variadic variants when they make sense:

.. concept:: Variable{Var} Example
             Type{X} ExampleType
             Variables{... Vars} Examples = (... && Example<Vars>)
             Types{... Xs} ExampleTypes = (... && ExampleType<Xs>)

    A dummy concept to showcase the documentation.

Construction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

These concepts are nearly equivalent to the corresponding trait (e.g. `std::is_constructible_v` and so on), but in
:ref:`concepts-for-variables` form:

.. concept:: template<Variable Var, typename... Inits> Constructible

.. concept:: template<Variable Var, typename Init> Assignable

.. concept:: Variable{Var} MoveConstructible
             Variables{... Vars} MoveConstructibles = (... && MoveConstructible<Vars>)

.. concept:: Variable{Var} MoveAssignable

.. concept:: Variable{Var} CopyConstructible
             Variables{... Vars} CopyConstructibles = (... && CopyConstructible<Vars>)

.. concept:: Variable{Var} CopyAssignable

As well as some shortcuts:

.. concept:: Variable{Var} Movable = MoveConstructible<Var> && MoveAssignable<Var>
             Variables{... Vars} Movables = (... && Movable<Vars>)

.. concept:: Variable{Var} Copyable = CopyConstructible<Var> && CopyAssignable<Var>
             Variables{... Vars} Copyables = (... && Copyable<Vars>)

There are construction concepts that make it easy to constrain factory :ref:`functions <function>`:

.. concept:: Variable{Var} Forwardable
             Type{X} ForwardableType
             Variables{... Vars} Forwardables = (... && Forwardable<Vars>)
             Types{... Xs} ForwardableTypes = (... && ForwardableType<Xs>)

    For factories that use :ref:`forward-storing` for their arguments::

        ForwardableType{Param}
        foo_type<Param> foo(Param&& param)
        {
            return { std::forward<Param>(param) };
        }

.. concept:: Variable{Var} Storable
             Type{Var} StorableType
             Variables{... Vars} Storables = (... && Storable<Vars>)
             Types{... Xs} StorableTypes = (... && StorableType<Xs>)

    For factories that decay their arguments::

        StorableType{Param}
        foo_type<std::decay_t<Param>> make_foo(Param&& param)
        {
            return { std::forward<Param>(param) };
        }

Iterators
^^^^^^^^^

These correspond to the Standard iterator concepts, but in :ref:`concepts-for-variables` form:

.. concept:: Variable{It} InputIterator
             Type{It} InputIteratorType

.. concept:: InputIterator{It} ForwardIterator
             InputIteratorType{It} ForwardIteratorType

.. concept:: ForwardIterator{It} BidirectionalIterator
             ForwardIteratorType{It} BidirectionalIteratorType

.. concept:: BidirectionalIterator{It} RandomAccessIterator
             BidirectionalIteratorType{It} RandomAccessIteratorType

As well as the non-standard:

.. concept:: Variable{Iter} Iterable
             Type{Iter} IterableType

    :notation:
      ::

          Iter iter;
          auto first = ops::begin(iter);
          auto last  = ops::end(iter);

    A variable which can provide a readable, notional sequence of elements via models of `InputIterator` provided
    through the `ops::begin` and `ops::end` operations::

        auto first = ops::begin(iter);
        auto last  = ops::end(iter);
        for(; first != last; ++first) {
            auto&& elem = *first;
            // use elem
        }

    :requirements:
        `ops::begin(iter) <ops::begin>`, `ops::end(iter) <ops::end>`: obtain an initial and final `InputIterator` into
        the notional sequence respectively---both results must have identical types, and *last* must be reachable from
        *first*

Invocation
^^^^^^^^^^

.. var:: constexpr functors::invoke invoke

    .. function:: template<typename Func, typename... Args> \
                  constexpr unspecified operator()(Func&& func, Args&&... args) const

        Invoke *func* given arguments *args...*. This is an implementation of the Standard *INVOKE* protocol with no
        given converted return type.

.. var:: template<typename Result> \
         constexpr functors::invoke_as<Result> invoke_as

    :tparam Result: Converted return type.

    .. function:: template<typename Func, typename... Args> \
                  constexpr Result operator()(Func&& func, Args&&... args) const

        Invoke *func* given arguments *args...* and implicitly convert the result to `Result`. This is an implementation
        of the Standard *INVOKE* protocol with a given converted return type.

        `Result` may also be ``void`` or `unit_type`, in which case the result is discarded.

.. concept:: template<Variable Func, typename... Args> OnceInvokable
             template<typename Func, typename... Args> OnceInvokableType

    :notation:
      ::

          Func func;
          Args args...;

    A variable that can be once-invoked given some arguments. Note that the ``Args`` are not constrained to be models of
    `Variable`.

    :associated expressions:
      ::

          annex::invoke(std::forward<Func>(func), std::forward<Args>(args)...);
          // N.B. ------^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Forwarding gives an opportunity to *func* to optimise the invocation, but it means that *func* should be treated
    with caution if the invocation was final in the case that *func* was effectively moved from::

        template<typename Func, typename... Params>
        void example(Func&& func, Params const&... params)
            requires
                // first invocations constraint
                OnceInvokableType<Func&, Params const&...>

                // possibly final invocation constraint
                OnceInvokableType<Func, Params const&...>
        {
            // first invocation
            annex::invoke(func, params...);
            // second invocation possible: func has not been forwarded
            annex::invoke(func, params...);

            // possibly final invocation
            annex::invoke(std::forward<Func>(func), params...);

            // invoking again would be ill-advised: func may have been
            // moved-from or otherwise pilfered
        }

    .. seealso::
        `Invokable`, `InvokableType`
            Non-forwarding variants that should be preferred if *func* is not being forwarded and will be called
            repeatedly.

.. concept:: template<Variable Func, typename... Args> Invokable
             template<typename Func, typename... Args> InvokableType

    :notation:
      ::

          Func func;
          Args args...;

    A variable that can be invoked repeatedly given some arguments. Note that the ``Args`` are not constrained to be
    models of `Variable`.

    :associated expressions:
      ::

          annex::invoke(func, std::forward<Args>(args)...);

    .. seealso::
        `OnceInvokable`, `OnceInvokableType`
            Forwarding variants, applicable for one-shot invocations.

.. concept:: template<typename Result, Variable Func, typename... Args> OnceInvokableAs
             template<typename Result, typename Func, typename... Args> OnceInvokableAsType

    Variants of `OnceInvokable` and `Invokable` except specified in terms of `annex::invoke_as\<Result\> <invoke_as>`
    instead of `annex::invoke`.

.. concept:: template<Variable Pred, typename... Args> Predicate
             template<typename Pred, typename... Args> PredicateType

    :notation:
      ::

          Pred pred;
          Args args...;

    A refinement of `Invokable\<Pred, Args...\> <Invokable>`, which further requires that the invocation
    result must be a model of `ContextualBool`.

    :associated expressions:
      ::

          bool { annex::invoke(func, std::forward<Args>(args)...) };

.. concept:: template<Variable Pred, typename Lhs, typename Rhs = Lhs> Equivalence
             template<typename Pred, typename Lhs, typename Rhs = Lhs> EquivalenceType

    :notation:
      ::

          Pred pred;

    A refinement of `Predicate` (see additional requirements) where *pred* induces an equivalence relation, meaning it
    respects the axioms of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity when called on arguments with types `Lhs` or `Rhs`.

    :additional requirements:
      `Predicate\<Pred, Lhs, Lhs\> <Predicate>`

      `Predicate\<Pred, Rhs, Rhs\> <Predicate>`

      `Predicate\<Pred, Lhs, Rhs\> <Predicate>`

      ``nullable = {}``: reset the variable to a null state, such that ``!nullable`` holds afterwards
