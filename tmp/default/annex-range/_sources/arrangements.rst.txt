Arrangements
============

A variable and not necessarily finite number of ranges, typically in the guise of a `Traversable` of ranges, can be
arranged together to form a new range. This is to be contrasted with :doc:`compositions`, where a fixed and finite
number of ranges gives rise to a new range. Some arrangements have a composition counterpart.
