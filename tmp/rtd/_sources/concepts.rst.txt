Taxonomy of ranges
------------------

.. concept:: Variable{Rng} Range

    .. warning:: |experimental-feature|

    :notation:
      ::

          Rng rng;

    A range contains all the necessary information to iterate over some notional sequence of elements. 'Notional' here
    means that the elements need not be actual C++ references or objects living in the program, but may instead be
    computed on demand.

    A range is a triple of a context, an inclusive lower bound position, and an exclusive upper bound position. They all
    together form a bounded range context where the positions are associated with their context (see :ref:`copy-save`).
    They are respectively accessible as ``rng.context``, ``rng.from``, and ``rng.to``. Furthermore, a range must be
    decomposable as a triple meaning that all three members may be accessed in one go::

        auto&& [ctx, low, high] = rng;
        assert( &ctx  == &rng.context );
        assert( &low  == &rng.from    );
        assert( &high == &rng.to      );

    The `context_t`, `position_t`, and `sentinel_t` associated types can be used to query the respective types of these
    members.

    The range context is that information that is position-independent but nonetheless necessary to carry out the range
    operations. In turn the range positions need only store position-specific information. For instance, a range over a
    strided sequence of ``int``\s in memory could be represented as such::

        // implementation of range operations omitted
        struct strided_memory_range {
            struct context_type {
                std::ptrdiff_t stride;

                struct position_type {
                    int* value;
                };
            };

            using position_type = context_type::position_type;

            context_type context { 1 };
            position_type from {}, to {};
        };

        int data[] = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 };
        auto r = strided_memory_range { { 2 }, { std::begin(data) }, { std::end(data) } };

    All positions share the same stride, so it is best stored inside the context. Whereas what distinguishes a position
    from any other is what particular ``int`` they refer to (or whether they are the special past-the-end value).
    Provided that appropriate range operations are implemented for ``strided_memory_range``, then in this example *r*
    would be standing for the notional sequence of integers :math:`\left\{ 0, 2, 4, 6 \right\}`.

    :requirements:
      `Rng` must provide a ``position_type`` to enable the `position_t` associated type that is appropriate for the
      *from* member, and may optionally provide a ``sentinel_type`` associated type if *to* has a different type.

      The *context* member must implement range operations appropriate for the *from* and *to* positions. In other
      words, `context_t\<Rng\> <context_t>` must be a model of `Context` or one of its refinements
      (`DoubleEndedContext`, `BidirectionalContext`, or `RandomAccessContext`) and `position_t\<Rng\> <position_t>` must
      be equivalent to `position_t\<context_t\<Rng\>\> <position_t>` (likewise for `sentinel_t\<Rng\> <sentinel_t>` and
      `sentinel_t\<context_t\<Rng\>\> <sentinel_t>`).

      Since *from* and *to* define a half-open interval of elements, only the positions up to but not equal to *to*
      (with respect to `equal_pos`, see `Context`) satisfy the preconditions for `peek_at`, `at`, and `incr`. In other
      words and as with iterators, *to* is considered to be the past-the-end position and is not required to have an
      associated element.
    :associated types:
      `context_t`, `position_t`, `sentinel_t`

.. concept:: Variable{Ctx} Context

    :notation:
      ::

          Ctx ctx;
          position_t<Ctx> from;
          position_t<Ctx> const cfrom; sentinel_t<Ctx> const cto;

    A range context. All the position-independent information together with the operations necessary to represent a
    notional sequence.

    :requirements:
      `Ctx` must provide a ``position_type`` member type to comply with `position_t`, and may optionally provide a
      ``sentinel_type`` member type.

      |position_t| and |sentinel_t| must model `Movable`. The range context and positions must follow the :ref:`range
      copying and moving rules <copy-save>` and implement the :ref:`range operations <operations>` with constant time
      complexity with respect to the number of elements of the sequence:

       - `equal_pos(ctx, cfrom, cfrom) <equal_pos>`
       - `equal_pos(ctx, cfrom, cto) <equal_pos>`
       - `equal_pos(ctx, cto, cto) <equal_pos>`
       - `at(ctx, cfrom) <at>`
       - `peek_at(ctx, cfrom) <peek_at>`, which must be convertible to `meta::as_const\<element_t\<Ctx\>\> <element_t>`
       - `incr(ctx, from) <incr>`

      Whenever equality of positions is mentioned, this is with respect to the context-aware, ternary `equal_pos`
      operation. |position_t| and |sentinel_t| are not required to be `EqualityComparable`, and if they are equality
      comparison is not required to agree with `equal_pos`.

      .. note::
          Elements may indifferently be references or objects.
    :associated types:
      `position_t`, `sentinel_t`

      `peek_element_t`: the result type of `peek_at` given appropriate context and positions

      `element_t`: the result type of `at` given appropriate context and positions

.. concept:: Context{Ctx} DoubleEndedContext

    .. warning::
        |experimental-design|

    :notation:
      ::

          Ctx ctx;
          sentinel_t<Ctx> to;
          position_t<Ctx> const cfrom; sentinel_t<Ctx> const cto;

    A `Context` which can be read from both ends.

    :requirements:
      The range context and positions must implement :ref:`double-ended range operations <double-ended-operations>` with
      constant time complexity with respect to the number of elements of the sequence:

       - `peek_before(ctx, cto) <peek_before>` with type |peek_element_t|
       - `before(ctx, cto) <before>` with type |element_t|
       - `decr(ctx, to) <decr>`

      .. note::
          Both `Context` and `DoubleEndedContext` allow for |position_t| and |sentinel_t| to be different types. This
          means that `before(ctx, to) <before>` is not equivalent to `at(ctx, prev(ctx, to)) <at>` in the general case.
          Using `peek_at`, `at`, and `incr` on |sentinel_t| positions is not defined for `Context` and
          `DoubleEndedContext` (and similarly `peek_before`, `before`, and `decr` on |position_t| positions).

          `BidirectionalContext` and its refinements provide these guarantees.

.. concept:: DoubleEndedContext{Ctx} BidirectionalContext

    :notation:
      ::

          Ctx ctx;
          position_t<Ctx> pos;

    A `DoubleEndedContext` which |position_t| and |sentinel_t| positions are the same `Copyable` type (also see:
    :ref:`copy-save`). Additionally the following is guaranteed:

     - `at(ctx, pos) <at>` is equivalent to `before(ctx, next(ctx, pos)) <before>`
     - `before(ctx, pos) <before>` is equivalent to `at(ctx, prev(ctx, pos)) <at>`

    There is a similar relationship between `peek_at` and `peek_before`.

.. concept:: BidirectionalContext{Ctx} RandomAccessContext

    :notation:
      ::

          Ctx ctx;
          position_t<Ctx> a, b;
          difference_t<Ctx> const offset;

    A `BidirectionalContext` which positions can be stepped multiple positions forwards or backwards at a time.

    :requirements:
      The range context and positions must implement :ref:`random-access range operations <random-access-operations>`
      with constant time complexity with respect to the number of elements of the sequence:

       - `step(ctx, a, offset) <step>`
       - `difference(ctx, a, b) <difference>`

      `step(ctx, a, offset) <step>` must accept |difference_t| offset arguments as long as they don't result in
      attempting to step *a* beyond bounds. Put another way, if *from* and *to* are the bounds of the range (see
      `Range`) then *offset* must lie within `[difference(ctx, from, a), difference(ctx, a, to)] <difference>`.

      For all positions the following is guaranteed:

       - `step(ctx, a, difference_t\<Ctx\> { 1 }) <step>` is equivalent to `incr(ctx, a) <incr>`
       - `step(ctx, a, difference_t\<Ctx\> { -1 }) <step>` is equivalent to `decr(ctx, a) <incr>`
       - `difference(ctx, a, a) == difference_t\<Ctx\> { 0 } <difference>`
       - `difference(ctx, a, b) == -difference(ctx, b, a) <difference>`

      Given ``difference_t<Ctx> const n = difference(ctx, a, b);``, the following is guaranteed:

       - `step(ctx, a, difference_t { 0 }) <step>` does not move *a*
       - `step(ctx, a, n) <step>` would make *a* equal to *b*
       - `step(ctx, b, -n) <step>` would make *b* equal to *a*
    :associated types:
      `difference_t`: the decayed result type of `difference`, must be a model of `SignedIntegral`

.. concept:: Variables{... Rngs} Ranges = (... && Range<Rngs>)

    A variadic variant of `Range`.

.. _copy-save:

Ranges and copying/moving
-------------------------

.. _copy-save-pass:

Positions
^^^^^^^^^

Since positions should only store as much information as necessary to uniquely stand for a particular notional element
(or the past-the-end value), it is required that copying, moving, or assigning to a position be a constant time
operation with respect to the number of elements of the sequence.

Additionally, while range positions are required to be `Movable`, they should model `Copyable` carefully and only when
it makes sense. Consider the following::

    // assumed to have length at least 2
    auto&& [ctx, pos, to] = rng;
    // copy a position
    auto remember = pos;
    incr(ctx, pos);
    auto&& read_at_1 = peek_at(ctx, pos);
    auto&& read_at_0 = peek_at(ctx, remember);

In this fragment the element at offset 1 is read before the element at offset 0. There are ranges for which this doesn't
make sense, e.g. many cases involving I/O such as reading from a socket. In these cases it is not possible to draw the
second element without reading or skipping over the first, after which it is often not available for reading anymore.

Hence positions should only ever be `Copyable` if they provide a multi-pass guarantee that would make the above fragment
valid and sensible. Conversely positions that are `Movable` but not `Copyable` are known as single pass, and are
associated with a particular context. Note that this gives the justification as to why a `BidirectionalContext` must
provide `Copyable` positions: decrementing a position that was previously incremented is equivalent to returning it to
its former state::

    auto&& [ctx, from, to] = rng;

    // (1)
    {
        auto pos = from;
        incr(ctx, pos);
        auto&& read_at_1 = peek_at(ctx, pos);
        decr(ctx, pos); // (2)
        auto&& read_at_0 = peek_at(ctx, pos);
    }

    // same as (1)
    {
        auto pos = from;
        auto remember = pos;
        incr(ctx, pos);
        auto&& read_at_1 = peek_at(ctx, pos);
        pos = remember; // same as (2)
        auto&& read_at_0 = peek_at(ctx, pos);
    }

.. note::
    `at` and `before` are potentially destructive reads and the multi-pass guarantee does not change that. The guarantee
    provides that `at` or `before` may be called multiple times on the same notional element via different access
    'paths' (i.e. without regard as to how the positions are computed), but not that their results will be stable.

This is similar to the distinction between an `InputIterator` and a `ForwardIterator`. An `InputIterator` does not
follow regular `Copyable` semantics as two or more copies of a given iterator are not equivalent: as soon as a copy is
read from, the others are invalidated for the purposes of iterator operations. This amounts to burdening the user with
handling move semantics by hand (since iterators predate the language-level move semantics of C++11) and is notoriously
error-prone. While C++11 moves are not entirely checked by the compiler and still leave room for use-after-move bugs,
making copies by accident is harder.

.. _copy-save-context:

Contexts and ranges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since a context stores whichever position-agnostic, auxiliary information is necessary for the purpose of representing a
notional sequence, there is no complexity requirement on its `save`, copy, move, or assignment operations.

.. rubric:: Moving

A context should only model `Movable` if the result of a move remains usable with any and all of its original associated
positions. In other words, moving a context must not invalidate positions::

    auto&& [ctx, from, to] = rng;
    assert( !equal_pos(ctx, from, to) );

    auto&& read_a = peek_at(ctx, from);

    auto target = std::move(ctx);

    // re-use from and to positions
    assert( !equal_pos(target, from, to) );

    // must have identical results to read_a
    auto&& read_b = peek_at(target, from);

.. rubric:: Saving

.. warning::
    |experimental-design|

Certain contexts may support saving, where a 'snapshot' of a given iteration is taken such that it can be iterated
separately. This is done with the `save` operation::

    // iteration state for some notional sequence
    auto&& [ctx, from, to] = rng;

    // separate state for an identical sequence
    auto&& [copy, low, high] = save(ctx, from, to);

The original positions should be used with the original context while the saved positions should be used with the saved
context. Operations on either the original range or the copy should not affect the other.

There is a dedicated concept for contexts which support saving:

.. concept:: Context{Ctx} Saveable

    :notation:
      ::

          meta::as_const<Ctx> ctx;
          position_t<Ctx> const from;
          sentinel_t<Ctx> const to;

    A context which supports saving. A context can be saved with any number of its associated positions.

    :associated expressions:
      `save(ctx, from) <save>`

      `save(ctx, to) <save>`

.. rubric:: Copying

If a range has both `Copyable` context and positions, then copying should be equivalent to saving::

    auto&& [ctx, from, to] = rng;

    // (1) saving
    {
        auto&& [saved, low, high] = save(ctx, from, to);
    }

    // (2) copying, same effects as (1)
    {
        auto copied = ctx;
        auto low  = from;
        auto high = to;
    }

The same applies if the `Range` itself is `Copyable`::

    // (3) copying again, same as (2)
    {
        auto [copied, low, righ] = rng;
    }

Lastly, a context with `Copyable` positions must only be `Copyable` if its positions can be used with any copy of the
context::

    auto&& [ctx, from, to] = rng;
    assert( !equal_pos(ctx, from, to) );

    auto copy = ctx;

    // must be valid
    at(ctx, from);

    // must also be valid
    at(copy, from);

In other words the positions must truly store position-specific information only, and should be indistinguishable by the
contexts. Otherwise, the context can still implement `save` specifically while remaining single-pass.

.. _range-properties:

Range properties
----------------

Altogether a `Range` has the following properties:

- its element types, given by `peek_element_t` and `element_t` respectively---ranges for which those types coincide can
  be described using just one element type
- its traversal (the most refined concept its `Context` models)
- whether it is multi-pass or not (see :ref:`Copying positions <copy-save-pass>`)
- whether its context is saveable or not (see :ref:`Saving contexts <copy-save-context>`)

Those same properties can be used for describing the context of a range, too.
